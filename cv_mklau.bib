abstract = {Given the significantly increasing frequency and intensity of droughts in Northeast China under climate change, it is necessary to understand drought-induced mortality in forest ecosystems. The magnitude of drought-induced forest mortality strongly depends on climate variability and forest age, which are both important driving factors of tree mortality. However, the age-related patterns and climatic driving factors of drought-induced forest mortality at large scales are poorly understood. This study identified the age-related pattern and the key climatic driving factors of drought-induced mortality for 17 dominant tree species in Northeast China using rain-use efficiency (RUE), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and tree-list information (species and diameter for every tree). Considering that climate variability and forest age are important factors of drought-induced mortality, species-specific analysis was conducted for describing age-dependent mortality patterns. The results showed that the mean annual rate of the drought-induced mortality of forests in Northeast China was 0.49%, with relatively high mortality rates in the Changbai Mountains and the eastern part of Liaoning Province. The sensitivity of age-dependent mortality patterns to climatic drivers of drought exhibited considerable variability. Resolving the contributions of precipitation deficits and heatwaves on the drought-induced mortality of trees, almost 91.60% of the forest region in Northeast China was found to be primarily affected by heatwaves (temperature anomalies), suggesting the important role of temperature extremes in forest mortality. The findings provide deeper insight into the mechanisms behind the species-specific formation of age-dependent patterns in Northeast China. This study provides a basis for the formulation of drought adaptation measures for forest species across successional stages and highlights the potential of remote sensing indices in identifying the patterns and climatic drivers of large-scale drought-induced forest mortality.}

ABSTRACT={<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Northern China is considered a global hotspot of biodiversity loss due to dramatic climate and land use change characterized by rapid urban expansion. However, little is known that the impacts of these two drivers in shaping the future availability of habitat for plants in urban areas of Northern China, especially at a high spatial resolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here, we modelled the habitat suitability of 2,587 plant species from the flora of Northern China and estimated how future climate and urban expansion may affect species-level plant biodiversity across three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios for the year 2050 in main city clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results suggested that climate and urban expansion combined could cause a decline of up to 6.5% in plant biodiversity of Northern China, while urban expansion alone may cause 4.7–6.2% and climate change cause 0.0–0.3% by 2050. The contribution of urban expansion was higher in urban areas, while the contribution of climate change was higher in natural areas. Species may lose an average of 8.2–10.0% of their original environmentally suitable area. Our results verified that the process of urban expansion would necessarily result in large-scale biodiversity loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The plant biodiversity loss in city clusters of Northern China was mainly determined by urban expansion rather than climatic change. The impact of climate change should not be ignored, since climate change will likely cause a higher reduction of area for some species. Based on these findings, we proposed that plant biodiversity loss in Northern China will accelerate in the future unless both urban expansion change and climate change are minimized.</p></sec>}}

abstract = {Abstract Functional traits impact species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have focused on the diversification and phylogenetic correlation of multiple functional traits over geological time. We conducted phylogenetic comparative analysis for boreal forest understory species in northeast China to examine the diversification and phylogenetic correlation in several functional traits: leaf area (LA), leaf carbon content (LCC), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), plant height (PH), and specific leaf area (SLA). Phylogenetic signals showed that there were very low levels of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) in understory leaf-related traits and plant height, suggesting divergence of functional traits for the co-occurring understory species. The disparity through time analyses (DTT) indicated that trait disparities mainly originated during recent divergence events and there were no differences in the observed trait disparities compared with that expected under Brownian motion. Furthermore, we found both positive and negative phylogenetic correlations among the measured functional traits. The very low levels of PNC suggest that these functional traits diverged among co-occurring understory species, and that those species are distantly phylogenetically related. The phylogenetic correlations among traits may be caused by both positively and negatively correlated adaptions that correspond to resource acquisition strategies. This study provides evidence that divergence in functional traits may reflect understory adaptions to boreal conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract Genetic variation in foundation tree species can strongly influence communities of trophic-dependent organisms, such as herbivorous insects, pollinators, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, the extent and manner in which this variation results in unexpected interactions that reach trophic-independent organisms remains poorly understood, even though these interactions are essential to understanding complex ecosystems. In pinyon–juniper woodland at Sunset Crater (Arizona, USA), we studied pinyon (Pinus edulis) that were either resistant or susceptible to stem-boring moths (Dioryctria albovittella). Moth herbivory alters the architecture of susceptible trees, thereby modifying the microhabitat beneath their crowns. We tested the hypothesis that this interaction between herbivore and tree genotype extends to affect trophic-independent communities of saxicolous (i.e., growing on rocks) lichens and bryophytes and vascular plants beneath their crowns. Under 30 pairs of moth-resistant and moth-susceptible trees, we estimated percent cover of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants. We also quantified the cover of leaf litter and rocks as well as light availability. Four major findings emerged. (1) Compared to moth-resistant trees, which exhibited monopodial architecture, the microhabitat under the shrub-like susceptible trees was 60\% darker and had 21\% more litter resulting in 68\% less rock exposure. (2) Susceptible trees had 56\% and 87\% less cover, 42\% and 80\% less richness, and 38\% and 92\% less diversity of saxicolous and plant communities, respectively, compared to resistant trees. (3) Both saxicolous and plant species accumulated at a slower rate beneath susceptible trees, suggesting an environment that might inhibit colonization and/or growth. (4) Both saxicolous and plant communities were negatively affected by the habitat provided by susceptible trees. The results suggest that herbivory of moth-susceptible trees generated litter at high enough rates to reduce rock substrate availability, thereby suppressing the saxicolous communities. However, our results did not provide a causal pathway explaining the suppression of vascular plants. Nonetheless, the cascading effects of genetic variation in pinyon appear to extend beyond trophic-dependent moths to include trophic-independent saxicolous and vascular plant communities that are affected by specific tree–herbivore interactions that modify the local environment. We suggest that such genetically based interactions are common in nature and contribute to the evolution of complex communities.},
